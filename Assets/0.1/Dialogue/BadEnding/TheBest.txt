<i> A piece of Jezebel remembers that she brought money to pay you. That fragment of her lets this slip from her mind while she focuses on her son.

She wont have much longer to focus on him while he's here.

She's grateful to you. But when the universe towers over you, it's hard to feel anything but terror and sorrow.

You've done what you can. </i>
